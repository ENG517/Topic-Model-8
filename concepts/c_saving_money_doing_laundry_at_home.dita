        <p>Wash full loads only: Wait until you have a full load to reduce the number of cycles you need to run, saving on water, energy, and detergent. Avoid overloading, because it can reduce cleaning effectiveness.</p>

        <p>Use cold water: Washing with cold water saves energy because it doesn’t require heating. Most clothes get just as clean in cold water, and it helps prevent colors from fading.</p>

        <p>Air dry when possible: Avoid using the dryer to save on energy costs. Air drying clothes on a rack or hangers is free, and it also helps your clothes last longer.</p>
