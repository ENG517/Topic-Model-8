    <p>As a student, laundry expenses can add up quickly. Here are some budget-friendly laundry tips to help you save money while making the most of your resources.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Wash full loads only: Wait until you have a full load to reduce the number of cycles you need to run, saving on water, energy, and detergent. Avoid overloading, because it can reduce cleaning effectiveness.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Use cold water: Washing with cold water saves energy because it doesn’t require heating. Most clothes get just as clean in cold water, and it helps prevent colors from fading.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Choose affordable and efficient detergent: Buy store-brand detergent, because it is usually cheaper. Look for concentrated formulas that require less per wash, helping you save money over time.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Air dry when possible: Avoid using the dryer to save on energy costs. Air drying clothes on a rack or hangers is free, and it also helps your clothes last longer.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Skip fabric softener: Fabric softeners can be an extra cost, and they’re not necessary for every load.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>Clean your washing machine regularly: A clean washer operates more efficiently, helping your clothes come out cleaner in less time. Run an empty cycle with vinegar once a month to remove buildup.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With these simple changes in your laundry routine, you can cut down on laundry expenses and make your budget go further. Saving a little with each wash can add up to big savings over time!</p>
