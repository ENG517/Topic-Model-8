  <title>Importance of sorting clothes</title>
  <shortdesc audience="novice">
  Clothes made from different fabrics react differently to washing conditions. For example, natural fibers like cotton and wool are prone to shrinkage in hot water, whereas synthetic fibers like polyester are more heat-resistant.  Sorting clothes before washing helps prevent damage, preserves fabric quality, and maintains colors.

    <p>Sorting clothes by color and fabric type is an essential step in the laundry process. Proper sorting prevents color bleeding, fabric damage, and ensures that each item is washed at the optimal temperature and detergent setting.</p>
    <p>Here are the main reasons why sorting clothes is important:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Prevents color bleeding: Washing dark or bright colors with whites can cause color transfer, leading to staining and dulling of lighter clothes.</p>

          Preserves fabric quality: Sorting by fabric type, such as delicates and heavy items, allows for gentle washing of delicate fabrics and helps prevent shrinkage and damage caused by rougher items.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensures effective cleaning: Heavily soiled items may need more detergent or a different washing cycle, while lightly soiled clothes can be washed with a shorter or gentler cycle.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By taking a few minutes to sort clothes before washing, you can maintain the appearance and longevity of your garments, saving time and money in the long run.</p>
