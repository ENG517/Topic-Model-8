  <shortdesc>Instructions on how to effectively remove coffee and oil stains from cotton or cotton-blend clothing using different cleaning methods and materials.</shortdesc>
  <taskbody>
    <note audience='novice'>
    <p>Different types of fabrics may require different cleaning approaches, as they can react differently to stain removers and washing techniques. These instructions can be used when washing cotton or cotton-blend clothes.</p>
    <p>Always check the care label before starting any stain removal process. The care label provides important information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Water Temperature**: Some fabrics may shrink or get damaged in hot water, while cotton can generally withstand warmer temperatures.</li>
      <li>**Cleaning Agents**: Certain fabrics are sensitive to specific chemicals, which can cause damage. Cotton is usually tolerant of stronger cleaning agents, but delicates like silk or acetate may require gentler products.</li>
      <li>**Drying Instructions**: The label indicates if the fabric should be machine dried, air-dried, or kept away from heat to avoid damage. Cotton is more heat-resistant, while synthetic fibers may shrink or warp.</li>
      <li>**Stain Removal Methods**: Some fabrics, like synthetics, may react poorly to common stain removers. Checking the label helps identify the safest cleaning method for each fabric type.</li>

    <li>Enzyme-based stain remover (spray or gel)</li>
    <li>Cornstarch or talcum powder</li>
    <li>Soft-bristled brush</li>
    <li>Dull knife, spoon</li>
    <li>Small bowl</li>
    <li>Paper towels or napkins</li>

<steps>
    <step>
      <cmd>Gently lift away any solid oil residue with the edge of a dull knife or spoon (if needed).</cmd>
      <choices>
        <choice>If the stain is fresh and there is no solid residue, blot the oily area with a paper towel or napkin to absorb excess oil.</choice>
      </choices>
    </step>
    <step>
      <cmd>Generously apply cornstarch or talcum powder to the stain to absorb as much oil as possible.</cmd>
      <info>Allow the powder to sit on the stain for about 15 minutes to fully absorb the oil.</info>
    </step>
    <step>
      <cmd>Brush the powder away with a soft-bristled brush.</cmd>
    </step>
    <step>
      <cmd>Pretreat the stain with an enzyme-based stain remover spray or gel.</cmd>
      <info>Let the stain remover sit on the stain for at least 15-30 minutes to allow enzymes to break down the oil.</info>
      <choices>
        <choice>If an enzyme-based remover isn't available, apply a heavy-duty liquid detergent directly to the stain and gently work it in with a soft-bristled brush or by rubbing the fabric with your fingers.</choice>
        <choice>For powdered detergent, make a paste with warm water and apply it to the stain.</choice>
      </choices>
    </step>
    <step>
      <cmd>Wash the clothes in the hottest water recommended for the fabric, using the recommended amount of heavy-duty laundry detergent.</cmd>
    </step>
    <step>
      <cmd>Look at the stained area after washing.</cmd>
      <info>Do not put the clothes in the dryer until you are confident that the stain has been removed. Air-dry the clothes if youâ€™re unsure, as dryer heat can set in the stain permanently.</info>
    </step>
    <postreq>
      <p>If the stain is older or set-in, follow these additional steps:</p>
      <steps>
        <step>
          <cmd>Place a white towel under the stained area to protect the rest of the clothing item.</cmd>
        </step>
        <step>
          <cmd>Using a cotton swab or paper towel, carefully dab a small amount of WD-40 onto the stained area.</cmd>
          <info>Do not use a large amount, as this may cause the stain to spread.</info>
        </step>
        <step>
          <cmd>Apply cornstarch or talcum powder to the area, then gently brush with a soft-bristled brush until the powder forms clumps, lifting the oil from the stain.</cmd>
          <info>Remove the clumps and repeat until only fine powder remains.</info>
        </step>
        <step>
          <cmd>Pretreat with a stain remover or heavy-duty laundry detergent and allow it to sit for 15-30 minutes before laundering as usual.</cmd>
        </step>
      </steps>
        <choices>
          <choice>Avoid letting oil stains sit on the fabric too long, as this can make them more difficult to remove.</choice>
          <choice>Do not rub or scrub the stain without a cleaning solvent, as this can push the oil further into the fibers.</choice>
          <choice>Always confirm the stain is fully removed before putting clothes in the dryer, as heat can set the stain permanently.</choice>
