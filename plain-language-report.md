The summary report should review the most significant aspects that you edited, revised, and redesigned throughout the model. (See the rubric for criteria.)
Provide examples that can either use (1) representative excerpt linked to a particular file in the repo, (2) screenshot images for comparison, and/or (3) links directly to pull requests.

## Document Revision Summary
We edited, revised, and redesigned our documents. 

### Fabric types
The original <shortdesc> was more generalized. It lacked specificity about the task or purpose of the instructions.

The new version of <shortdesc> narrows the focus, making the description more task-oriented and actionable.

The original paragraph (<p>) reads: "You will need the following materials:"
The revised paragraph (<p>) simplifies the phrasing: "Materials needed:"

Also  <choice> elements have been changed. We corrected a grammatical error ("their" â†’ "there").
We simplified the text, making it easier for users to read and act on instructions quickly.
The revised <choice> statements follow a similar structure, which improves the overall readability and cohesion of the list.

### Drying Clothes in University Laundry Machines
- Commands like "Load wet clothes into the dryer drum" and "Close the dryer door" are concise and direct, following the plain language principle of focusing on the main action.
- Notes like "Check the lint trap to ensure it is clean" provide essential safety information without overloading the main instruction.
- The file avoids deixis (e.g., "as described above") and relies on explicit commands, which improves clarity and reusability.
- Elements like <shortdesc> and <postreq> use conref to link to reusable content.

### Laundry Etiquette 
- Steps with multiple parts, such as handling another resident's laundry, are broken into substeps, making the instructions easier to follow.
- Instructions like "Give other residents a 15-20 minute grace period" clearly outline expectations for respectful behavior.
