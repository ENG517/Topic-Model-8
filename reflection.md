 As a group, write an analysis (~500 words) in a single-spaced memo format. Save it in the root of your project as reflection.md, wherein you write about the following:
Create a section for each user scenario of which your model responds,
Provide an outline of the DITA maps that respond to the scenario, and
Reference the maps and their outputs as a means to explain how the map and output responds to that scenario.

## User Scenarios
### User Scenario 1
Elena is a new NC State student moving into a dormitory for the first time. She has done her laundry before at her home, but is unfamiliar with the universityâ€™s machines and using a shared laundry room. She wants to clean her clothes in the dorm's laundry room.

This map is focused on the experience of washing laundry in a shared space. The task topics of washing/drying laundry are specific to the laundry mahcines found in communal laundry rooms on campus, since this user lives in a dorm. Additionally, since this user has never used a shared laundry room before, including common etiquette tips was important. This ensures the user understands any unwritten rules and respects both the space and their peers. The topics on removing stains, wash icons, and dry icons, are supplementary and will help any user understand how to wash their laundry correctly.

### User Scenario 2

Marina is a second-year student moving into her apartment at NC State. Her apartment has an in-unit washer and dryer. Marina has never washed her own laundry before, and in the past took her clothes back home for her parents to clean. She wants to learn how to do her own laundry.

Scenario 2 shares similar themes to scenario 1; however, this user has never washed their own laundry before and is using a different type of machine. The task topics for this scenario do not go into depth about the different setting configurations. We decided to include information about laundry icons to learn about different settings instead. A beginner user will likely not understand these icons without a reference sheet. Additionally, since this user lives in on-campus apartments, they will be using a stackable machine which operates differently compared to the communal machines. Laundry etiquette was not required since this is not a shared laundry facility. 

### User Scenario 3

Will is a second-year student who has done his own laundry before, both at home and in the dormitory laundry rooms. He has moved to an aprtment off campus and is wondering how he can improve the effciency of his laundry routine in order to save money.
