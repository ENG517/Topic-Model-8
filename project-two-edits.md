# Topic Model 8 Edits

Following Dr. Lindgren's feedback after **project two**, we made the following edits:

## Laundry Etiquette
- Changed this from a concept topic to a [task topic](/tasks\t_laundry_etiquette.dita).

## Saving Money
- Fixed formatting issues related to indentation
- Changed to a [task topic](\tasks\t_saving_money.dita)
- removed ```<p>``` tags in the list block elements
- corrected paragraph formatting

## Fabric Types
- Changed from a reference to a [task topic](/tasks\t_fabric_types.dita) since this topic mainly covers how to care for different fabrics rather than their properties
- If we were going to expand on this topic model, we could build more off of this one topic, creating a supporting concept and reference topic. We opted not to for simplicity of our model and to shift focus on PL ediitng.
  
## Communal drying
- Reformatted shortdesc
- Revised all notes to include types across all topics
- Added step importance to optional steps across all topics
- [This commit show an example of each](https://github.com/ENG517/Topic-Model-8/pull/19/commits/e1a43f49b7c19ee661212180d5c43e9f6d2482d3)

## Divided stain task topic
- We felt this task topic was overly long and could be easily divided into two tasks. One about [coffee stains](/tasks\t_how_to_remove_coffee.dita) and another about [oil stains](tasks\t_how_to_remove_oil.dita)

## Created concept topics
- Created [c_care_labels.dita](concepts\c_care_labels.dita) to briefly introduce care labels to users.
- Created [c_stain_science.dita](/concepts\c_stain_science.dita) to accompany the two task topics. We felt the tasks needed another topic to fall under.

## Ditamaps
- Updated [ditamaps](https://github.com/ENG517/Topic-Model-8/pull/34/commits/fb24aea0bf26c0784bc52e6324c214857a3ce133) to account for new/updated files
- One file (I can't remember which one atp) was causing major issues when outputting pdfs. We edited out all errors and were able to successfully output our pdfs
